      "description": "Wuqi is a coastal suburban district in Taichung with a beautiful origin. Its original name was Wucha but literati and scholars who frequented the place beautified the name and changed it into Wuqi, literally “to rest under the Wu-tong (Chinese Parasol) tree”. It is derived from a line of a Chinese poem that goes like this: “And the phoenix will rest on nothing but the Wu-tong tree”. Situated in Wuqi, Taichung Harbor Hotel features 200 elegant rooms. It is the first international tourist and business hotel at the central Taiwan coastline with a simple and stylish design. Refresh your body and mind in our comfortable and relaxing environment.
